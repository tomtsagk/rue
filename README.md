# Rue

A card game where all the players are sitting around a table. A rose appears on the table that moves around.

The aim of the game is for each player to have the rose in front of them at the end of the round. Each player can use cards that influence the roseâ€™s movement.

This game is currently in Alpha and still under active development.

## Build for Linux

Before building this game, you need to have the [avdl](https://notabug.org/tomtsagk/avdl) compiler installed.

Copy the `makefile.in` file and rename it to `makefile` (This step needs to be automated with `configure`).
Then use the following commands to build it:

    make

Once complete, and assuming no errors occur, the final game will be located in `build/native/out`.

## Build for Windows

Unfortunately this is not very straightforward. When building the project on a Linux machine using `make`,
the `avdl` compiler will create `.c` files of the source code. Those can then be used to
compile the windows version, linked against windows libraries.

This is planned to be improved.

## Build for Android

Before building this game, you need to have the [avdl](https://notabug.org/tomtsagk/avdl) compiler installed.
This works best ona Linux machine.

Copy the `makefile.in` file and rename it to `makefile` (This step needs to be automated with `configure`).
Then use the following commands to build it:

    make android

Once complete, and assuming no errors occur, there will be a few `.c` files located in `build/android/objects`.
These files can then be put in the Android project inside [avdl](https://notabug.org/tomtsagk/avdl) (located in
`engines/android`), together with the assets, and be build.

The last step is not very automated, and is planned to be improved.
